# Contour Segmentation
In this lesson, I learnt about segmenting images according to contours.

I use three examples, each more difficult than the last. I show the purpose of erosion and dilation in the finding of contours. I also show the various options in the
OpenCV's `findContours` function and how they affect the contours found.

I also use various ways to create a binary image that is necessary to find contours.

This goes together with another image segmentation mode already uploaded, color segmentation.

I have provided both the code, notebook and images used.
