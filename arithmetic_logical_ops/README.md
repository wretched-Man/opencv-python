This folder contains lessons on arithmetic and logical operations on images. There is also an application
<br>
section. This section on the application contains two applications of the logical and arithmetic operations.
Each notebook and .py file is well documented.

Two of the files used are the *X* logo by (X, formally Twitter) and Meta's Facebook logo by Facebook.
Also used is Python's logo by the Python Software Foundation.

**TODO:** - for the application on digital signatures, it is currently not running since I used my own signature
and had to remove it while posting. Therefore I have to add another signature file for use.
