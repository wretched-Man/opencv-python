# **Face detection for Automation**

In this lesson, we use OpenCV and PyautoGUI to control the keyboard.

We use a face detection model from Caffe to detect faces.

Based on the actions the face makes,
we can simulate the same in the keyboard.

All the documentation and explanaiton can be found in
the standalone Python code and the Jupyter Notebook.

The model is quite large hence has not been posted.

However, any Caffe framework model with an accompanying Prototxt
will do fine.
