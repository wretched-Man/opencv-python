# opencv-python
I have been doing a OpenCV University course on OpenCV with Python.
I have taken my own notes and done examples.
<br>
<br>
In each folder is an explanation of what is covered, the Jupyter notebooks for the same and the standalone code.
<br>
<br>
Also, the standalone code just like the notebooks use Matplotlib to display images. Use a suitable IDE for the standalone code to
be able to see the plots.
All the images for a particular module/folder are stored in the **images** subfolder, unless otherwise noted.
The notebooks are extensively documented and explain each block of code. In a limited fashion, the same also exist in the .py files.
<br>
<br>
**Note: ** As side effects, some notebooks or .py files generate images and store to disk.
