# Applications
As mentioned, I have given two examples of how to apply face detection.

## Face BLurring for Privacy
One of the applications is a face blurring application. Where a face is detected, we can blur the face while sharing to preserve someone's privacy.

## Smile detector
This uses facial landmarks on a detected face (that is fully or mostly frontal facing) and uses pre-definded constants to detect a face. Works reasonably well for a frontal facing face.
