# Face Detection
In this lesson, I studied face detection using OpenCV's dnn module. It was my first usage of the OpenCV dnn module, hence I used this opportunity to learn much of what I have expalained in the other folders.
I also integrated my learning with streamlit to demo a simple face detection application.

## Applications
Face detection has numerous applications. I have included two that I did i.e. privacy blurring and smile detection.
