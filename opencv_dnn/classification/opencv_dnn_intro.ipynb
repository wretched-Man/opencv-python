    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. OpenCV provides us with a deep learning module that allows us to do inferencing. This module is its own namespace `dnn`. A deep neural network is an ANN with multiple hidden layers of units between the input and output layers, which are composed of multiple linear and non-linear transformations. Unlike a shallow neural network, a dnn has multiple hidden layers which allows it perform better. "

Furthermore, since we can add layers and populate them, we can increase the functionality even more. Remember, the reason that OpenCV supports this module is because most Computer Vision tasks these days are done using deep learning, in the place of algorithms since deep learning solutions are more effective.\n",
