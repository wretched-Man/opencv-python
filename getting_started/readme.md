This is the introductory module.
<br>
As mentioned all images used are in the images folder. Any images created are created in the current folder.
<br>
This involved imtroduction to images, channels, saving and viewing images in Matplotlib and OpenCV.
<br>
It also involves annotating images. I went on a curious quest in this annotation exercise to know just how
and why a gray 3-channel image is still gray (Ik, curious)!
