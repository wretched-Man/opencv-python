# Camera Calibration
In this module, I went in depth into:
* Affine Transforms
* Homography
* Camera Calibration
* The Projective Matrix
* The Linear Camera Model

I show the difference between an affine transform and a homography. I also show how we can calibrate a camera using ArUco and ChArUco boards.
