# Color Segmentation
In this lesson, I studied one way of image segmentation, using color.
I have shown how segmentation both in the HSV and RGB color spaces can be done.
## Application
Also, I have an application section where I use color segmentation to study the rate of deforestation in an area between 1985 and 2011.


I have provided both the notebooks, images and code for the session.
### Sources
I have used Google's **G** logo for color segmentation.
I have also used images from [Pexels](pexels.com).
